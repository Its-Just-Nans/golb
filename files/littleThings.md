# Little Things

## Google highlight search

We can highlight text in a page with Chrome using a special hash/anchor :

```code
#:~:text=
```

> The hash/anchor isn't stocked in `window.location.hash` !

Example of URL :

```code
https://website.com/page#:~:text=text%20to%20highlight%20here
```

[Example](https://github.com/Its-Just-Nans#:~:text=You%20can%20check%20my%20github%20website)
